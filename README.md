## Objectives  :notebook_with_decorative_cover:(11 May 2023~)

1. ~~Import the environment, 3D models for the project.~~
2. Place Cubes to make the track for the plane.
3. ~~Create AircraftController.cs for the Engine component.~~
4. ~~Assigne one cube at a certain time.~~

## Work Log
1. Created Tracking.cs, which takes the cube and indicates the trigger if it hit the track in order to rotate the plane.
2. index = 1: to rotate left for the plane.
3. index = 2: to stop rotation.
4. index = 3: to turn y-angle to 180.
5. index = 4: to turn right.
6. Box Triggers can help to pop up 3D Canvas for the information for the User.
7. Created 2 tags for the colliders- InfoTag, Track. InfoTag is to print the 3D Canvas and Track is for the aircraft to turn left or right.
