## Work Log
1. Created Tracking.cs, which takes the cube and indicates the trigger if it hit the track in order to rotate the plane.
2. index = 1: to rotate left for the plane.
3. index = 2: to stop rotation.
4. index = 3: to turn y-angle to 180.
5. index = 4: to turn right.
6. Box Triggers can help to pop up 3D Canvas for the information for the User.
7. Created 2 tags for the colliders- InfoTag, Track. InfoTag is to print the 3D Canvas and Track is for the aircraft to turn left or right.
8. 16 Images done.
9. Placed 21 images in the game applications for UI.
10. Created Animation Controller for the IntroBanner.
11. Debugging the runway model.
